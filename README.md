# Body Temperature Detecting System - Software part

- This is the software part of *CSE521S Wireless Sensor Networks* in-class project. 
Our group made this system to measure body temperature and manage the admissions of people who might cought fever when entering buildings.

- My responsibilities:  
  - Designed and implemented functions based on MySQL database, e.g writing detected body temperature information into database, searching information under specified conditions
  - Implemented message-based alert function based on Amazon SNS
